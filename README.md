# ESPHome Altitude Azimuth Sun Tracker
 Inspired by the wonderful Horizon card for HACS, and the multi-cog designs for Alt-Azimuth telescope mounts and Tellurions (Earth-Sun-Moon animated toys), this project builds a real-life 3D Horizon Card to track the Sun using ESPHome and an Altitude-Azimuth mount.
